  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, add-github-action ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - uses: spack/spack-github-action@master
      - run: |
          spack repo add ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/gfarm-spark
          spack install gfarm gfarm2fs
      
      - uses: spack/spack-github-action@master
      - run: |
          spack repo add spa
